# Nginx snippet for serving SuperAdminFrontend (Vite SPA)
# Fix: "Expected a JavaScript module but server responded with MIME type application/octet-stream"
# Cause: Server serves .js without correct Content-Type. Browsers require application/javascript for <script type="module">.

# 1. Include MIME types (REQUIRED – otherwise .js is served as application/octet-stream)
include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
default_type application/octet-stream;

# 2. Optional: explicit types (use if mime.types is missing or wrong)
# types {
#     application/javascript js mjs;
#     text/css css;
# }

# 3. Location to serve the built app (dist/)
# Example server block:
#
# server {
#     listen 80;
#     server_name your-domain.com;
#     root /path/to/SuperAdminFrontend/dist;
#     index index.html;
#     include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
#
#     location / {
#         try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
#     }
#
#     location ~* \.js$ {
#         add_header Content-Type "application/javascript; charset=utf-8";
#     }
#     location ~* \.css$ {
#         add_header Content-Type "text/css; charset=utf-8";
#     }
# }
